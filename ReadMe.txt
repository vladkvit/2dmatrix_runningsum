*Problem statement*
Given a 2D array A, find a rectangle inside A such that it has the maximum possible sum. If multiple rectangles are possible, output the one with the largest area.

This project implements four different algorithms that solve that problem. The fastest implementation is O(n^3) where n is the larger side of the array A.

A similar approach can be done for a variant of the problem where we're trying to find the largest rectangle with zero sum.
